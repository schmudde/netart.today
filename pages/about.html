These links point to a place where net.art <em>happened</em>. The links are displayed along side of more traditional media: written biographical information and images of the artwork’s current state.</p><p>The holdings of Gallery 404 no longer function as the artists originally intended. Each artwork has yielded to the passing of time. But in a medium where calculations are made at unimaginable speeds, time itself seems to pass faster. Some of these artworks took less than a decade to decay into unrecognizable states.</p><p>Gallery 404 is net.art today. Much of what was created by the first generation of digital natives is now broken. While some works of net.art have benefited from institutional preservation, even these are vulnerable to software updates, infrastructure changes, and negligence.<a href="#fn-1">[1]</a> As software eats the world, it also consumes itself.</p><h1 id="the-preservation-of-net.art">The Preservation of net.art</h1><p>net.art is a peculiar art form. Its growth paralleled the emergence of the commercial internet. The lack of a formal language or framing device made the work difficult to spot; “art” websites and “non-art” websites looked similar. There were few celebrity practitioners and virtually no exhibition spaces.</p><p>The net.art movement liberated artists and audiences from Duchamp-style Modernism. Duchamp's Modernism crystallized when the artist submitted<em> Fountain</em>, a urinal bought at a hardware store in Manhattan, to the Society of Independent Artists exhibit in 1917.<em> Fountain </em>brought the power of art-signifying frames to the forefront: “this urinal is art because it is being exhibited as art.”</p><p>net.art lacked an equivalent to trendy exhibition spaces, deliberate lighting, and expensive picture frames. The blurred boundaries were reflected in pieces such as <em><a href="https://sites.rhizome.org/anthology/airworld.html">Airworld</a></em> and website awards like Alexei Shulgin’s<em><a href="http://www.easylife.org/award/"> WWWART MEDAL</a></em>, which presented “non-art” websites awards for providing a “definite ‘art’ feeling.”<a href="#fn-2">[2]</a></p><p>While much has been written on how the “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/25/magazine/25privacy-t2.html">internet never forgets</a>”, much of what was created in the last twenty plus years has disappeared from neglect or deliberate corporate purging. This includes countless websites, Flickr (2019), and Tumblr (2018) accounts, all of Google+ (2019), all of Geocities (2009), and 50 million songs by 14 million artists on MySpace (2003-2015).<a href="#fn-3">[3]</a></p><p>net.art was a generation's attempt to plant a cultural stake in cyberspace. Their work is a reflection of what the internet was and could be. But the cultural artifacts of the first digital natives are quickly being lost to time. Gallery 404 presents this broken history in its unvarnished reality.</p><h1 id="historical-context">Historical Context</h1><p>The world wide web is just one part of the internet. Some historical context will help convey the difference between net.art and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telematic_art">telematic art</a> that existed in the years prior.<a href="#fn-4">[4]</a></p><ul class="pl4-ns pl2"><li>30 August 1969: the ARPANET, an early <strong>military computer network</strong>, comes online in the United States.

For example, as the internet started to shift from interoperable public spaces to siloed corporate spaces by the turn of the millennium, parallel concerns about the corporatization of the internet are reflected in prominent net.art artworks like <em><a href="http://history.etoy.com/stories/entries/49/index.html">Toywar</a></em> (1999) and the aforementioned <em><a href="https://sites.rhizome.org/anthology/airworld.html">Airworld</a></em> (1999). </p><p>It can be difficult to see a technology’s implicit political bias decades removed from its use.
