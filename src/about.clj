Following hyperlinks at a whim, web surfers would travel haphazardly through the net, stumbling upon sites that ranged significantly in quality and subject matter. One of the perks of such navigation is that the distinction between art sites and non-art sites could go unstated. In a reversal of Duchamp’s famous assertion of the power of art-signifying frames (the idea that a ready-made object can be transformed into an art object simply by referring to it as one), visitors were allowed to stumble upon net.art sites without knowing they were viewing an artwork at all. Alexei Shulgin’s [:a {:src "http://www.easylife.org/award/"} "WWW Art Medal"], for example, presented various non-art sites awards for giving the viewer a “definite ‘art’ feeling.”
