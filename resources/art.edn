  :desc "«Digital Landfill», one of Napier’s most well-known works of Net art, is a sort if virtual compost heap. The artist has developed an interface that allows a user to copy data from his or her own computer or from other Web sites, and thus, to put it plainly, to dump it. Within seconds, the data appears in various layers on the computer monitor. As if you were combing through dumping grounds layer by layer, you dig deeper and deeper into the overripe information.
Besides the unreadable texts in this computer-generated collage, familiar icons from the Net appear here and there. The Yahoo! Logo, the homapage of the CIA, press releases from Microsoft and playmates from Playboy’s Web site emerge from the digital chaos, looking as if they really were slowly rotting there on Napier’s server, decaying on some Internet-based compost-heap. […]
One could call «Digital Landfill» a work of automated Pop Art. The multiple layers of pop culture icons and ‹found footage› from the Internet are reminiscent of Robert Rauschenberg’s silk screens, with at least one obvious yet important difference: with «Digital Landfill», it’s not a single artist who determines the theme and its arrangement. The work is far more the result of the contributions of all its ‹users’› who end up creating a sort of collective art work."

  "The TeleGarden is an art installation that allows web users to view and interact with a remote garden filled with living plants. Members can plant, water, and monitor the progress of seedlings via the tender movements of an industrial robot arm. ``In linking their garden to the World Wide Web and creating an intuitive interface for the control of the arm and camera, the artists transformed what most would consider a fit of over-engineering into a subtle rumination on the nature of the Commons.'' -- Peter Lunenfeld, Flash Art , XXIX, 187, March 1996. ``The Telegarden creates a physical garden as an environment to stage social interaction and community in virtual space. The Telegarden is a metaphor for the care and feeding of the delicate social ecology of the net.'' -- Randall Packer, San Jose Museum of Art, April 1998. The Telegarden went online in June of 1995 and has been online continuously for seven years. It currently is located in the Ars Electonica Museum in Austria. Anyone can view the garden as a guest; the rights to plant and water are granted to those who agree to share their email addresses with other members of the cooperative. Activity is recorded in logs so that the cooperative can be self-governing.",

  "Indeed, as Martin said, VERY competent programming, runs like a charm and is a pleasure to look at. I notice that Golan uses the \"official\" United Nations map projection, rather than a strict lat/lon projection. Don't you think it over-emphasizes Europe and Africa? I love the sense of humor (if you can call it humor) and the very \"professional\" code comments (\"...and a secret handshake. Ours is wicked cool.\"). I also very much appreciate the content-driven approach. Sometimes the axis \"description\" is a little forced and redundant, but often it is quite funny, and certainly points to the redundancy of political agendas in the first place. The funniest descriptions depend on the countries one chooses. This highlights a certain property common to many interactive and generative pieces, it really matters what the user does. This is not a bad thing, I think it is ultimately very much the point.",

It's a fascinating piece because as I write code, I always have an image in mind of how the routines are calling each other, passing control here and there and back again, and it's great to see an actual picture of this happening. Not surprisingly, it is as boggling an image in actuality as it often is in my head.\" ",

  "I was hoping someone would do ASCII art with the code and sure enough, Maciej did. His \"main\" is indeed only seven lines but in his \"library,\" where all the work gets done, the code becomes a form of concrete poetry. It also serves to make the code completely unreadable. Sheesh Maciej, you just won't give anything away for free!",

  "Mark merges the inherent chaos of a Double Pendulum with the noisy personality of an Euler integrator, to great effect. There are some nice patterns to be found in the code: iteration, simulation, a delicately hand-rolled Bresenham's line, alpha blending. I think the Javascript reload is forceful and a little risky: having been burned one too many times by browsers, I might have tried to find a way to clear the scene from within the applet code itself. It doesn't matter. The piece has good staying power. Run it overnight.\"",

  "\"recentevents\" consists of a flowing stream of letter tokens. As the tokens intermingle, they extend sticky tendrils to one another that form clots of letters, or words. Letters and clots that find many potential partners grow forked spidery bundles of tendrils as they compete to attract their prospective neighbours. As the process continues, the clots eventually coalesce to reveal three recent events siphoned from a BBC world service news feed.",
