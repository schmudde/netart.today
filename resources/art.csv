1998,Digital Landfill,http://www.potatoland.org/landfill/,Mark Napier,"«Digital Landfill», one of Napier’s most well-known works of Net art, is a sort if virtual compost heap. The artist has developed an interface that allows a user to copy data from his or her own computer or from other Web sites, and thus, to put it plainly, to dump it. Within seconds, the data appears in various layers on the computer monitor. As if you were combing through dumping grounds layer by layer, you dig deeper and deeper into the overripe information.
Besides the unreadable texts in this computer-generated collage, familiar icons from the Net appear here and there. The Yahoo! Logo, the homapage of the CIA, press releases from Microsoft and playmates from Playboy’s Web site emerge from the digital chaos, looking as if they really were slowly rotting there on Napier’s server, decaying on some Internet-based compost-heap.

Members can plant, water, and monitor the progress of seedlings via the tender movements of an industrial robot arm. ``In linking their garden to the World Wide Web and creating an intuitive interface for the control of the arm and camera, the artists transformed what most would consider a fit of over-engineering into a subtle rumination on the nature of the Commons.'' -- Peter Lunenfeld, Flash Art , XXIX, 187, March 1996. ``The Telegarden creates a physical garden as an environment to stage social interaction and community in virtual space. The Telegarden is a metaphor for the care and feeding of the delicate social ecology of the net.'' -- Randall Packer, San Jose Museum of Art, April 1998. The Telegarden went online in June of 1995 and has been online continuously for seven years. It currently is located in the Ars Electonica Museum in Austria.

I love the sense of humor (if you can call it humor) and the very ""professional"" code comments (""...and a secret handshake. Ours is wicked cool.""). I also very much appreciate the content-driven approach. Sometimes the axis ""description"" is a little forced and redundant, but often it is quite funny, and certainly points to the redundancy of political agendas in the first place. The funniest descriptions depend on the countries one chooses. This highlights a certain property common to many interactive and generative pieces, it really matters what the user does. This is not a bad thing, I think it is ultimately very much the point.",https://www.digitalartarchive.at/database/general/work/axis.html,2020-11-07,axis-2020-11-08 15-17-57.png,Digital Art Archive,https://www.digitalartarchive.at/database/general/work/axis.html,,applet

The writing style is not as smooth as Golan's, for example -- in code, if not in drawing, I definitely favor the ""easy on the eyes,"" but in the case of this work, it seems the only way to get the job done is through brute force. It's a fascinating piece because as I write code, I always have an image in mind of how the routines are calling each other, passing control here and there and back again, and it's great to see an actual picture of this happening.
